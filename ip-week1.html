    <ol>
        1.<h3><strong>Software installations;</strong></h3>
        <p>The first step to becoming a software developer is knowing the type of software to use. During the

        Slack channel communication app and Zoom meeting app.</p>
        2.<h3><strong>Command line and Terminal</strong></h3>

        <p>Git is a free and open distributed version control system too to manage your source code history.
        Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It simply lets you and others 
        work on projects from anywhere.</p>
        4.<h3><strong>HTML</strong></h3>
        <p>HTML simply stands for Hyper Text markup Language. It is used to create web pages and describe 
        their structure as well. It is made up of series of elements that tells browser how to display content. </p>
